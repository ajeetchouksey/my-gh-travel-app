# Infra Setup

## Introduction
This document provides comprehensive instructions for building infrastructure using an AI agent. It covers the necessary steps and considerations to successfully set up an infrastructure environment that leverages AI capabilities.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- Basic knowledge of cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Familiarity with AI concepts and tools
- Access to the necessary cloud account and permissions

## Setting Up the Environment
1. **Select a Cloud Provider**: Choose your preferred cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).
   - Example: For AWS, create an account at [aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com).

2. **Install Required Tools**: Ensure you have the required command-line tools installed.
   - For AWS, install the AWS CLI:
     ```bash
     pip install awscli
     ```
   - For GCP, install the Google Cloud SDK:
     ```bash
     curl https://sdk.cloud.google.com | bash
     ```

3. **Configure Your CLI**: Set up the command-line tools with your credentials.
   - For AWS:
     ```bash
     aws configure
     ```
   - For GCP:
     ```bash
     gcloud init
     ```

## Defining Infrastructure Requirements
1. **Identify Resources**: Determine which resources you need (e.g., VMs, databases, networking).
2. **Define Specifications**: Write down the specifications for each resource.
   - Example:
     - EC2 Instance: t2.micro, 1 vCPU, 1 GB RAM
     - RDS Database: db.t2.micro, MySQL, 20 GB storage

## Executing Infrastructure Setup
1. **Create Resources**: Use your cloud provider's dashboard or CLI to create the resources.
   - AWS CLI example for EC2:
     ```bash
     aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-12345678 --count 1 --instance-type t2.micro
     ```

2. **Automate with Scripts**: Create scripts to automate the setup process.
   - Example script for AWS CloudFormation:
     ```yaml
     Resources:
       MyInstance:
         Type: AWS::EC2::Instance
         Properties:
           InstanceType: t2.micro
           ImageId: ami-12345678
     ```

## Validating the Deployment
1. **Check Resource Status**: Verify that all resources are running as expected.
   - For AWS:
     ```bash
     aws ec2 describe-instances
     ```

2. **Access Your Services**: Test access to services (e.g., SSH into an EC2 instance).
   - Example:
     ```bash
     ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@your-instance-ip
     ```

## Monitoring and Maintenance
1. **Set Up Monitoring Tools**: Utilize cloud monitoring tools to keep track of resource performance.
   - For AWS, use CloudWatch to monitor metrics.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --alarm-name "High CPU Alarm" --metric-name CPUUtilization --namespace AWS/EC2 --statistic Average --period 300 --threshold 70 --comparison-operator GreaterThanThreshold
     ```

2. **Regular Maintenance**: Schedule regular maintenance tasks (e.g., updates, backups).

## Troubleshooting
1. **Common Issues**: Document common issues and their resolutions.
   - Issue: Instance fails to start
     - Solution: Check if the instance type is supported in your region.

2. **Logs and Diagnostics**: Use logs to diagnose issues.
   - Example for AWS:
     ```bash
     aws logs describe-log-groups
     ```

## Conclusion
Following these steps will help you set up and maintain your infrastructure using an AI agent effectively. Always stay updated with the latest tools and practices for optimal performance.
