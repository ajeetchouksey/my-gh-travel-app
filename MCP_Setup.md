# MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server Setup

This document provides a step-by-step guide to creating and setting up an MCP server.

---

## **1. Define the Purpose of the MCP Server**

Decide the purpose of the MCP server. Typical use cases include:
- Real-time collaboration
- Sharing trip planning data
- Enhancing AI models

---

## **2. Set Up the Environment**

### **Choose a Hosting Platform**
- Cloud providers: AWS, Azure, GCP
- Local setup: Docker or standalone servers

### **Install Dependencies**
- Programming language runtime (e.g., Node.js, Python, etc.).
- Framework or libraries that support MCP.

---

## **3. Develop the MCP Server**

### **Create MCP Server Code**
- Implement request handling using REST APIs or WebSockets.
- Add endpoints for specific functionalities (e.g., saving, retrieving, and updating data).

### **Authentication and Security**
- Use tokens or API keys for secure communication.
- Enable HTTPS for encrypted communication.

---

## **4. Test the MCP Server**

- Write unit tests for server methods and APIs.
- Simulate client-server communication to ensure data flows correctly.

---

## **5. Deploy the MCP Server**

- Deploy to your chosen hosting platform.
- Set up DNS and SSL certificates for secure access.

---

## **6. Integrate the MCP Server with the Application**

- Update client-side APIs to communicate with the MCP server.
- Test the integration for seamless functionality.

---

## **7. Monitor and Maintain**

- Use monitoring tools to track server performance.
- Regularly update the server to patch vulnerabilities.

---

## **8. Additional Notes**

- Ensure scalability if the server is expected to handle high traffic.
- Document the APIs and share them with the development team.
