# User Management

## User ID Management

When a user accesses the web app, prompt them to provide their app ID. If the user does not have an app ID, give them the option to generate one. This app ID will be used for all future interactions to perform user-relevant operations. 

### Storage Recommendation
- Store the app ID securely in your backend database or a secure token-based session management system.
- Avoid storing any personal information directly in your app to ensure user privacy and comply with data protection regulations.

## User Data Handling

### Data Storage and Retrieval
- Allow users to save the data they provide in a local CSV file. 
- Prompt the user to specify the file location for saving the data.
- Use this CSV file to retrieve the user's previous data for making recommendations and performing pattern analysis.

### MLOps Pipeline for Data Analysis
- Implement an MLOps pipeline to analyze user data patterns and train machine learning models.
- Use the pipeline to:
  - Make personalized recommendations.
  - Perform detailed pattern analysis to enhance user experience.
- Ensure the pipeline is scalable and can handle data from multiple users efficiently.

## Privacy and Compliance
- Do not store personal information directly in the app.
- Utilize anonymized app IDs and encrypted data storage to protect user privacy.
